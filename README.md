# StochasticGradientDescent

Implementation of Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm used in Linear Regression in Matlab

Possible Future improvements/New features
Implement concepts such as Momentum and variable learning rate that helps speed up SGD, reach global minima and decrease the oscillation around such minima.
